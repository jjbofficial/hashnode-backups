# Embedded Developer Communities in Ghana ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡­

I am very passionate about embedded systems and electronics. Programming devices to respond to real-life stimuli hits differently and I knew that there was no way that I am the only one in Ghana that thinks like that. However, it was hard for me to find local communities or meet-ups that were focused on embedded systems but I was eventually able to join a few. So I have decided to create a list on GitHub of these communities and also other people that you can follow and network with. I want others to have an easier time finding these communities. You can view the list [here](https://github.com/jjbofficial/embedded-developer-communities-in-ghana)
