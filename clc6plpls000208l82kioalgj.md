# Getting electronic components for your next project in Ghana

Once I started trying to follow online tutorials to build electronic projects, I quickly ran into an issue of finding where I can buy these modules and electronic components. I wanted to find local shops that I could buy from since shipping everything would be too expensive. The list below is all shops which I have personally purchased components from.

* [Okuelectronics](https://okuelectronics.com)
* [Geekelectronics](https://geekelectronics.io)
* [ACL](https://anycomponentlab.com)
* [Nauvitel Electronics](https://nauvitel.com)

Although the shops above usually had the parts that I needed, I sometimes had to buy some parts from outside Ghana especially when I wanted to work on projects that used surface mount components. The main thing I looked for was cheap shipping since I don't buy in high volume and the site delivers products to Ghana. I found two sites that work for me

* [LCSC](https://lcsc.com) 
* [Aliexpress](https://aliexpress.com)

**Note: You can sometimes order parts from Aliexpress that don't work. You should make sure to compare prices on Aliexpress to other sites and read the comments.**
